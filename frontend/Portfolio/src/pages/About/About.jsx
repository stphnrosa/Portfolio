       <h2> <b>Hi, I'm Stephanie!</b>  Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Over the past year, I completed an intensive, full-time software engineering program at Per Scholas, where I gained hands-on experience designing, building, and deploying full-stack web applications. My training emphasized RESTful API development, state management with React Hooks and Context API, backend architecture with Express and MongoDB, and version control using Git and GitHub. I collaborated in agile team environments, participated in code reviews, and followed best practices in debugging, testing, and deployment. </h2>
